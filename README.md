# LRU-Cache
The purpose of this assignment was to simulate the behavior of an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache.  The program was written in C for an Operating Systems Fundamentals course. The program makes use of a caching algorithm that will evict the least recently used page to make room for a new page. The underlying data structures that make the program function are doubly linked lists.
